    <h1>The Golden Ring of Siberia</h1>
    <p>The writer Valentin Rasputin compared Siberia to a separate planet, on which humanity could start a new life based on the resources available there. Everything needed to create a civilization can be found here. "The Golden Ring of Siberia" (Discovering Siberia) is a customizable route: you can change the stages of the journey as you wish, with the only static point being the starting point located in Tomsk. A shorter version, known as the "Small Ring," includes six regions in various combinations for those who want to split their introduction to Siberia into multiple stages.</p>
    <p>Getting acquainted with the national flavor begins with the wooden architecture of the Siberian Athens, as Tomsk is called, the cultural and educational capital of Russian Asia. The city's main treasure is its unique architecture, with over a thousand wooden buildings adorned with carved lintels, roof frames, and window surrounds featuring pagan symbolism that speaks of the land's richness, fertility, and protective talismans. Tomsk is a city of the taiga, which is why wood was the primary building material for a long time. Later, stone buildings appeared, designed in Baroque and Russian Art Nouveau styles.</p>
