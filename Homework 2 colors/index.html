        <p>The founders of the Slavic alphabet are the Thessalonian brothers <span style="color: blue;">Cyril and Methodius</span>. Their biographies hold a special place among the oldest monuments of Slavic literature. The father of the scholars, Cyril and Methodius, came from a noble family. Methodius held a high state position as a stratigos but later became a monk. Constantine (Cyril), from the very beginning, pursued a spiritual path. He mastered all the ancient arts and spoke several foreign languages. In the late 862, Moravian Prince Rostislav sent envoys to the Byzantine Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_III">Michael III</a>, requesting teachers who could educate the Slavs about Christian books. Cyril and Methodius were chosen for this task. Before their departure, the future Slavic enlighteners created an alphabet, basing it on the Greek alphabet and adapting it for the sounds of the Slavic language.</p></div>

        <p>Old Russian literature didn't mechanically borrow but creatively transformed <strong>Byzantine and Bulgarian literary</strong> traditions with which it was closely connected. Kievan Rus' absorbed the ascetic Byzantine tradition and did not embrace the capital Constantinopolitan culture, instead focusing primarily on Christian literature while excluding the ancient literature that had been widely prevalent in Byzantium.</p></div>
